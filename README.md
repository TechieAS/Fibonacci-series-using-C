# Fibonacci Program

This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

## Description

- The program defines a recursive function `fibonacci(int n)` to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
- The `main()` function initializes `n` to 5 and prints the corresponding Fibonacci number.
- The program uses standard C libraries (`stdio.h`) for input and output.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
2. Run the program:
3. The output will display:


## Notes

- The current implementation is recursive, which may not be efficient for large values of `n`.
- Consider using an iterative approach or memoization for optimization.
